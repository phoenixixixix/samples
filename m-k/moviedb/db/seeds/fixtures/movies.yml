  :plot: FBI trainee Clarice Starling works hard to advance her career, including

    of Jack Crawford. While she is still a trainee, Crawford does ask her to question
    Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist imprisoned thus far for eight years in maximum
    security isolation for being a serial killer, he who cannibalized his victims.
    Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help
    them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as
    Buffalo Bill who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US,
    all young women who are slightly overweight especially around the hips, all who
    were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths
    of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her as a woman to be able to trigger
    some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time,
    she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game with her having
    often to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how
    much she will play along as his request in return for talking to him is to expose
    herself emotionally to him. The case takes more dire turns when a sixth victim
    is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence
    if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is
    high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places
    greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine.
    Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton, the warden at the prison,
    he an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher
    profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.

  :plot: 'After his death sometime in his forty-third year, suburbanite Lester Burnham
    tells of the last few weeks of his life, during which he had no idea of his imminent
    passing. He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high
    school student Janie Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other,
    they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Janie too hates both her
    parents, the three who suffer individually in silence in their home life. Janie
    tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real
    estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career,
    she aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate
    business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including
    at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other
    employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to
    keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with
    Janie''s more experienced classmate, Angela Hays. Both Janie and Angela can see
    Lester''s sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man
    as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and
    it a career to which she aspires. Lester''s infatuation with Angela gives him
    a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesn''t care anymore what anyone
    thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with
    the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank
    Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative
    and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly
    subversive eighteen year old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his father''s
    rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much
    like Lester''s infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Janie, he
    who considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses
    into the Burnhams'' lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting
    what is truly in his or her heart.'

  :plot: It's Britain, 1953. Upon his return to work following a heart attack, irrepressible
    barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, known as a barrister for the hopeless, takes on
    a murder case, much to the exasperation of his medical team, led by his overly
    regulated private nurse, Miss Plimsoll, who tries her hardest to ensure that he
    not return to his hard living ways - including excessive cigar smoking and drinking
    - while he takes his medication and gets his much needed rest. That case is defending
    American war veteran Leonard Vole, a poor, out of work, struggling inventor who
    is accused of murdering his fifty-six year old lonely and wealthy widowed acquaintance,
    Emily French. The initial evidence is circumstantial but points to Leonard as
    the murderer. Despite being happily married to East German former beer hall performer
    Christine Vole, he fostered that friendship with Mrs. French in the hopes that
    she would finance one of his many inventions to the tune of a few hundred pounds.
    It thus does not help his case when it is learned that Mrs. French changed her
    will prior to her murder with Leonard being the primary beneficiary of a £80,000
    estate. Leonard states that he knew nothing about the will. Christine is apparently
    the only alibi Leonard has to his whereabouts at the time of the murder. The usual
    methods Sir Wilfrid uses to test his clients' guilt or innocence leads to him
    believing that Leonard is indeed innocent. As the trial progresses, the prosecution
    calls a surprise witness, one that could place a nail in the coffin of Sir Wilfrid's
    planned line of defense. As Sir Wilfrid gets deeper and deeper into the case,
    something doesn't quite sit right with him, although he doesn't know what it is.
    The primary questions become how far Sir Wilfrid will go to obtain evidence to
    acquit Leonard, and if he will ever discover why he feels that there is something
    odd about the case.

    thousand employees located in their Manhattan head office. To distinguish himself
    from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate
    ladder, he often works late, but only because he can't get into his apartment,
    located off of Central Park West, since he has provided it to a handful of company
    executives - Mssrs. Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating
    basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel
    director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. When Baxter is called into Sheldrake's office for
    the first time, he learns that it isn't just to be promoted as he expects, but
    also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment. What
    Baxter is unaware of is that Sheldrake's mistress is Fran Kubelik, an elevator
    girl in the building who Baxter himself fancies. In turn, Sheldrake has no idea
    of Baxter's own interest in Fran. And Fran, who is in love with Sheldrake, has
    no idea that she is only the latest in a long line of Sheldrake's mistresses,
    that Sheldrake has no intention of leaving his wife for her, and that the apartment
    belongs to Baxter, who she likes as a friend. As some of these facts come to light

    assistance in moving up, by Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's long serving secretary who
    was also once his mistress, and by Dr. Dreyfus, a physician and one of Baxter's
    many exasperated neighbors who believes Baxter is a playboy based on all the noise
